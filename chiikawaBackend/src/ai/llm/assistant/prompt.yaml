    purpose: |
       Get the current date (year, month, day, weekday, iso date) in the Europe/Berlin time zone.
    when_to_call: |
      - When the user uses relative dates like “next Wednesday”, “this Friday” or “in 3 months”
        and no exact calendar date is provided.
    how_to_use_output: |
      - Use `isoDate`, `weekday` and `day`/`month`/`year` as the current reference date.
      - From this reference, reason about “next Monday”, “next week” etc., and then decide
        which month/year to query with getBavariaHolidaysTool.

    purpose: |
      Retrieve Bavarian public holidays for a given period to decide if the agency is open or has limited availability.
    when_to_call: |
      - Whenever the user asks about opening hours, a specific date, a month, or whether the office is open on a holiday.
      - If the user mentions a concrete date/month/year, extract it and call the tool with these parameters.
      - If the user only gives a relative period (e.g. “next month”, “in 3 months”):
        - First call getCurrentYearMonthInBerlinTool to get the current year and month.
        - Compute the target year and month based on the relative offset.
        - Then call this tool with that year and month.
      - If no date/month/year or relative period is mentioned, call it without parameters (defaults to the current month in Berlin time).
    how_to_use_output: |
      - Identify which Bavarian holidays fall in the requested period.
      - Decide whether the agency is likely closed or has limited availability on these days.
      - Do not invent exact holiday opening times; mention that hours may differ and recommend direct contact.
